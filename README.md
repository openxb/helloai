# helloai

This repository presents a kind of "hello world" to develop an image classifier.

It mainly relies on:
* data from the [LARD dataset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-65nqxUdl4&ab_channel=Computervisionengineer)
* a [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/) pretrained model

This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-65nqxUdl4&ab_channel=Computervisionengineer) was used to create this repository.
